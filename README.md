## Introduction
  On the landing page, a randomized user will see all available recipes displayed after scrolling through some testimonials for displayed recipes. The user may click on any single recipe that shows a modal with details such as instructions, ingredients and cost of ingredients. The user can search a keyword and when the "search" button is clicked, any recipe with the keyword included in its name will appear. The user can also select one or multiple filter tags. 
  If a user clicks the "star" icon on a recipe card, that recipe will be added to the "cookbook" tab. When the user goes to the "cookbook" tab, they can search and filter their favorite recipes, and remove a recipe from favorites by deselecting the "star" icon.

## Challenges
This was our team's first time working with the following technology and concepts, which naturally came with a learning curve as we implemented them into our project:

- External data sets
- Using API Fetch calls to pull in the data
- Writing our own tests in order to follow TDD - we have previously followed pre-existing tests when building projects
- This is the first iteration of our project and was completed in one week
